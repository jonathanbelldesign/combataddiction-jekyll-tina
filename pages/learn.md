  section_title: First Steps
  section_body: '<p>It takes a lot of courage to seek help for a drug problem. However,
    treatment does work, and people are recovering from addiction every day. Like
    other chronic diseases, addiction can be managed successfully. Treatment enables
    people to counteract addiction''s powerful, disruptive effects on brain and behavior
    and regain control of their lives.</p><h6>Source: <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/step-by-step-guides-to-finding-treatment-drug-use-disorders/if-you-have-problem-drugs-adults/how-to-find-help">Drugabuse.gov</a></h6><p>Alcoholism,
    drug dependence, and addiction, known as substance use disorders, are complex
    problems. People with these disorders once were thought to have a character defect
    or moral weakness; some people mistakenly still believe that. However, most scientists
    and medical researchers now consider dependence on alcohol or drugs to be a long-term
    illness, like asthma, hypertension (high blood pressure), or diabetes. Most people
    who drink alcohol drink very little, and many people can stop taking drugs without
    a struggle. However, some people develop a substance use disorder—use of alcohol
    or drugs that is compulsive or dangerous (or both).</p><p>Source: “<a href="https://store.samhsa.gov/product/What-Is-Substance-Abuse-Treatment-A-Booklet-for-Families/SMA14-4126"

  section_title: Common Myths
  section_body: '<p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "Addiction only happens to certain kinds
    of people."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> Addiction can happen to anyone, no matter
    their race, upbringing, personality type, or grade point average. Genetic, social,
    and psychological risk factors, and early use, can put some people at greater
    risk, but the potential exists for anyone.<br></p><p class="p1"><strong>MYTH:</strong>
    "If you have an addiction, you just don’t have enough willpower."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong>
    If you are living with an addiction, it doesn’t mean you’re weak. It simply means
    you might need help. Treatment providers and recovery support communities are
    local resources that can help you find hope and recovery.<br></p><p class="p1"><strong>MYTH:</strong>
    "Addiction medications are just replacing one addiction with another."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong>
    Medications for addiction, including for opioid use disorder, have been proven
    to save lives and substantially improve recovery rates. Medications don’t create
    a high or cause impairment—they allow patients to work, drive, care for their
    families, and live full lives.<br></p><p class="p1"><strong>MYTH:</strong> "People
    who are addicted to drugs are bad people."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> People
    with a drug addiction might be moody, have memory loss, or even have trouble thinking
    and making decisions. This is because of the changes in their brain from the drugs.
    It does not mean someone is a bad person.<br></p><p class="p1"><strong>MYTH:</strong>
    "People with addiction are hopeless."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> People can
    and do recover from addiction. In fact, millions of Americans are thriving in
    recovery right now. <br></p><p class="p1"><strong>MYTH:</strong> "People have
    to hit “rock bottom” before they can get well."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> This
    simply isn’t true - and it’s dangerous. The longer a person waits, the more their
    addiction advances. People who get help before their illness is so severe have
    more resources to draw upon to help them successfully recover. So the sooner someone
    gets help, the better.</p><p>Sources: <a href="https://easyread.drugabuse.gov/content/what-addiction">Drugabuse.gov</a>,

  section_title: Harm Reduction
  section_body: '<p>“Harm reduction can be described as a strategy directed toward
    individuals or groups that aims to reduce the harms associated with certain behaviours.
    When applied to substance abuse, harm reduction accepts that a continuing level
    of drug use (both licit and illicit) in society is inevitable and defines objectives
    as reducing adverse consequences. It emphasizes the measurement of health, social
    and economic outcomes, as opposed to the measurement of drug consumption.”</p><p>Source:

  section_title: Relapse Education
  section_body: '<h3>What is a relapse?</h3><p>A person who''s trying to stop using
    drugs can make mistakes, feel bad, and start using again. This return to drug
    use is called a relapse. Relapse is common and normal and happens to a lot of
    people recovering from drug addictions. People will often have one or more relapses
    along the way. It takes practice to learn how to live without drugs. Stopping
    drug use is like trying to diet and lose weight. It''s hard to learn to do things
    differently, like eat less, exercise more, and avoid some favorite foods. It''s
    easy to slip up, eat too much, and gain back the weight. But then you have to
    try again. It''s the same with quitting drugs. People with drug addictions might
    get treatment, slip up, and then go back to treatment many times before it works.
    If that happens, the person should get back into treatment as quickly as possible.</p><h3>Danger
    of Overdose</h3><p>For some drugs, a relapse can be very dangerous—even deadly.
    If a person stops taking drugs and then takes the amount they used before quitting,
    they can easily overdose. Their body is no longer used to having the same amount
    of the drug in its system. An overdose happens when a drug causes serious, harmful
    symptoms or death. This is why it''s important to take a treatment plan seriously.
    Treatment can help to lower the chance of a drug relapse and overdose.</p><p>Source:

  section_title: All About Overdose
  section_body: '<h3>Recognizing Opioid Overdose</h3><p>Sometimes it can be difficult
    to tell if a person is just very high, or experiencing an overdose. The following
    will present some information on how to tell the difference. If you’re having
    a hard time telling the difference, it is best to treat the situation like an
    overdose – it could save someone’s life.</p><p><strong>If someone is really high
    and using downers like heroin, or pills:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Pupils will contract
    and appear small</p></li><li><p>Muscles are slack and droopy</p></li><li><p>They
    might “nod out”</p></li><li><p>Scratch a lot due to itchy skin</p></li><li><p>Speech
    may be slurred</p></li><li><p>They might be out of it, but they will respond to
    outside stimulus like loud noise or a light shake from a concerned friend.</p></li><li><p>If
    you are worried that someone is getting too high, it is important that you don’t
    leave them alone. If the person is still conscious, walk them around, keep them
    awake, and monitor their breathing.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The following are
    signs of an overdose:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Loss of consciousness</p></li><li><p>Unresponsive
    to outside stimulus</p></li><li><p>Awake, but unable to talk</p></li><li><p>Breathing
    is very slow and shallow, erratic, or has stopped</p></li><li><p>For lighter skinned
    people, the skin tone turns bluish purple, for darker skinned people, it turns
    grayish or ashen.</p></li><li><p>Choking sounds, or a snore-like gurgling noise
    (sometimes called the “death rattle”)</p></li><li><p>Vomiting</p></li><li><p>Body
    is very limp</p></li><li><p>Face is very pale or clammy</p></li><li><p>Fingernails
    and lips turn blue or purplish black</p></li><li><p>Pulse (heartbeat) is slow,
    erratic, or not there at all</p></li></ul><p>If someone is making unfamiliar sounds
    while “sleeping” it is worth trying to wake him or her up. Many loved ones of
    users think a person was snoring, when in fact the person was overdosing. These
    situations are a missed opportunity to intervene and save a life.</p><p>It is
    rare for someone to die immediately from an overdose. When people survive, it’s
    because someone was there to respond.</p><p>The most important thing is to act
    right away!</p><p>Source: <a href="https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/recognizing-opioid-overdose/">Harm

  section_title: Safe Disposal of Drugs
  section_body: <p>At some point or another, there may be unused medications from
    a past illness or injury in the home. While it may be tempting to keep them “just
    in case,” there are some big risks to consider.</p><ul><li><p>These medications
    are a significant poisoning risk for children and pets, who may mistake them for
    candy or other food.</p></li><li><p>A drug may be safe for one person, yet a single
    dose may be fatal for another person.</p></li><li><p>The medicine may expire,
    and not work the way it was intended to. It might even hurt the person taking
    it.</p></li><li><p>The drug might be intentionally misused or abused by teens,
    or stolen and sold by others.</p></li><li><p>Keeping extra medicine around can
    increase the risk of taking the wrong medicine, or too much medicine.</p></li></ul><p>Safe
