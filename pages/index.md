  - body: <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "People have to hit 'rock bottom' before they
      can get well."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> This simply isn’t true, and it’s
      dangerous. The longer a person waits, the more their addiction advances. People
      who get help before their illness is so severe have more resources to draw upon
      to help them successfully recover. So the sooner someone gets help, the better.</p>
  - body: <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "People with addiction are hopeless."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong>
      People can and do recover from addiction. In fact, millions of Americans are
      thriving in recovery right now. </p>
  - body: <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "People who are addicted to drugs are bad people."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong>
      People with a drug addiction might be moody, have memory loss, or even have
      trouble thinking and making decisions. This is because of the changes in their
      brain from the drugs. It does not mean someone is a bad person.</p>
  - body: <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "Addiction only happens to certain kinds of people."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong>
      Addiction can happen to anyone, no matter their race, upbringing, personality
      type, or grade point average. Genetic, social, and psychological risk factors,
      and early use, can put some people at greater risk, but the potential exists
      for anyone.</p>
  - body: <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "If you have an addiction, you just don’t have
      enough willpower."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> If you are living with an addiction,
      it doesn’t mean you’re weak. It simply means you need help. Finding a medical
      treatment plan or recovery support community can help you heal.</p>
  - body: <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> "Addiction medications are just replacing one
      addiction with another."<br><strong>REALITY:</strong> Medications for addiction,
      including for opioid use disorder, have been proven to save lives and substantially
      improve recovery rates. Medications don’t create a high or cause impairment—they
      allow patients to work, drive, care for their families, and live full lives.</p>
