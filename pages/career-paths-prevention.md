**Prevention practitioners** work with individuals, families, schools, and communities to help prevent the development of substance use disorders and other addictions. The [**New York State Office of Addiction Services and Supports**](https://oasas.ny.gov/credentialing/prevention-professional-or-specialist-cpp-and-cps) (OASAS) issues two credentials for this field:

* Credentialed Prevention Specialist
* Credentialed Prevention Professional

As seen in the information at the link above, various educational paths can lead to these certifications (including degrees offered in Chautauqua County).

In Chautauqua County, Prevention Works is an alcohol and other drug prevention agency approved and supported by OASAS.  Learn more about the field of addiction prevention by [**contacting**](https://preventionworks.us/contact.php) Prevention Works.
