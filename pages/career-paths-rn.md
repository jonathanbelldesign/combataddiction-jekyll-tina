**Registered Nurses** (RNs) work in a wide variety of settings providing and coordinating patient care.  RNs can specialize in various healthcare fields, including addiction.

To practice nursing as an RN in New York State, you must be licensed and registered by the [**New York State Education Department (NYSED**)](http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/nurse/nursingrn.htm).

[**Jamestown Community College**](https://www.sunyjcc.edu/programs/nursing-aas) offers a 2-year RN nursing degree that prepares you to take the National Council of State Boards for Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) to become a registered nurse.
