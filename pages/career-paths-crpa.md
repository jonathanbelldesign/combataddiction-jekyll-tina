**Certified Recovery Peer Advocates** (CRPAs) draw from personal experience with substance use, plus professional training, to provide non-clinical support services. CPRAs may help those in treatment/recovery in the development of recovery plans, effective coping habits, and life skills for navigating recovery.

The [**New York State Office of Addiction Services and Supports**](https://oasas.ny.gov/recovery/become-certified-recovery-peer-advocate) (OASAS) authorizes the credentialing of recovery peers through the [**New York Certification Board**](http://nycertboard.org/).

To learn more about recovery peers in Chautauqua County, contact the [**Mental Health Association**](http://www.mhachautauqua.org/contact) and/or [**Recovery Options Made Easy**](https://recoveryoptionsny.org/peer-support/)**.**
