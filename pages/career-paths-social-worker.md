**Social workers** help people cope with and/or solve challenges they are facing by assisting them to obtain services; providing counseling or psychotherapy with individuals, families, and groups; and/or helping communities or groups provide or improve social and health services.   Social workers in the addiction field promote well-being through assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention services.  Social workers function in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, schools, human service agencies,  and community organizations.
